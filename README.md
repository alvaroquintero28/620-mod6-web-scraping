See [BeautifulSoup Quickstart Guide](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#quick-start)

Choose a BeautifulSoup parser:

- 'html.parser' (default, you get this with BeautifulSoup)
- 'html5lib' (install separately if desired)

## Getting Started

Fork (copy into your GitHub account) and clone down (to your machine) this repo to get started with web scraping.

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment. 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Before starting the project, try all these imports FIRST

# Address any errors you get running this code cell 

# by installing the necessary packages into your active Python environment.
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
pip install html5lib
# Try to resolve issues using your materials and the web.

# If that doesn't work, ask for help in the discussion forums.

# You can't complete the exercises until you import these - start early! 

# We also import pickle and Counter (included in the Python Standard Library).
